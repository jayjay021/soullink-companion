# Authentication System Implementation Plan

## Overview
Implement a self-hosted LAN-only authentication system for the SoulLink companion app. The system will support anonymous users initially with a simple username setup stored in localStorage, with plans for future authentication features.

## Requirements

### Current Requirements (Phase 1)
- [x] **Self-hosted only** - LAN usage initially, extensible for future
- [x] **Anonymous/guest users** - No complex authentication
- [x] **Simple username setup** - First-time dialog with just a username field
- [x] **Local storage persistence** - User data stored locally and retrieved on refresh
- [x] **Backend user creation** - Username sent to backend to create user record
- [x] **Non-unique usernames** - Multiple users can have the same username
- [x] **Changeable usernames** - Users can update their username
- [x] **Session integration** - Remove automatic player creation, use User instead of Player

### Future Requirements (Phase 2)
- [ ] **Real authentication** - Email/password login system
- [ ] **Social login** - OAuth integration (Google, GitHub, etc.)
- [ ] **Admin system** - Initial admin user creation, user management
- [ ] **Role-based access** - Admin and user roles

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Simple Username-Based System

#### Backend Changes âœ… COMPLETED

##### 1. Database Schema âœ…
- [x] Create users table with future-proof schema
```sql
-- Users table (future-proof for admin/auth)
CREATE TABLE users (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
  username VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
  email VARCHAR(255) UNIQUE, -- NULL for now, required later
  password_hash VARCHAR(255), -- NULL for now, required later
  role VARCHAR(20) DEFAULT 'user', -- 'user' or 'admin'
  created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW(),
  updated_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW()
);
```

##### 2. API Schema Updates âœ…
- [x] Add User schemas to OpenAPI spec:
  - [x] `User` - User object with id, username, createdAt
  - [x] `CreateUserRequest` - Username only
  - [x] `CreateUserResponse` - Wrapped user object
  - [x] `GetUserResponse` - Wrapped user object
  - [x] `UpdateUserRequest` - Username update

##### 3. API Endpoints âœ…
- [x] `POST /api/v1/users` - Create new user
- [x] `GET /api/v1/users/:id` - Get user by ID
- [x] `PUT /api/v1/users/:id` - Update user (username)

##### 4. Session Integration âœ…
- [x] Remove automatic player creation from session endpoints
- [x] Update session schemas to use `User` instead of `Player`
- [x] Session creation/joining now requires valid user ID
- [x] Update existing session endpoints to accept user ID in request body/headers

##### 5. Pokemon Integration âœ…
- [x] Update Pokemon model to use `userId` instead of `playerId`
- [x] Update Pokemon service and controller to use `userId`
- [x] Update database schema and apply migrations

#### Frontend Changes ðŸ”„ IN PROGRESS

##### 1. User Context & Provider
- [ ] Create `AuthContext` with user state management
- [ ] Store user data in localStorage with key `soullink-user`
- [ ] Provide user data throughout the app
- [ ] Handle user loading on app startup

##### 2. User Setup Dialog
- [ ] Modal component that appears on first visit
- [ ] Simple username input field (2-50 characters)
- [ ] Create user via API and store response locally
- [ ] Prevent app usage until user is set up

##### 3. User Management
- [ ] Settings page/component to change username
- [ ] Update both backend and localStorage when username changes
- [ ] User profile display in header/navigation

##### 4. API Integration
- [ ] Add user-related API hooks to `useApi.ts`
- [ ] Update existing session hooks to include user context
- [ ] Pass user ID in API requests where needed

### Phase 2: Future Authentication System

#### Admin System
- [ ] **Initial Admin Creation**
  - [ ] Environment variable for initial admin credentials
  - [ ] First startup creates admin user if none exists
  - [ ] Admin can manage users, sessions, system settings

#### Email/Password Authentication
- [ ] Add email field (required, unique)
- [ ] Add password_hash field
- [ ] JWT token-based authentication
- [ ] Login/logout endpoints
- [ ] Password reset functionality

#### Social Login
- [ ] OAuth integration (Google, GitHub, etc.)
- [ ] Link social accounts to existing users
- [ ] Account linking/unlinking

#### Migration Strategy
- [ ] **Database**: Design current schema to accommodate future fields
- [ ] **API**: Version endpoints (`/api/v1/` vs `/api/v2/`)
- [ ] **Frontend**: Gradual migration with feature flags

### Test Coverage:
- User loading from localStorage
- User creation and error handling
- User updates and validation
- Logout functionality
- Form validation in UserSetupDialog
- Authentication flow integration
- Session management with authentication
- Error states and loading states
- First-time vs returning user experiences

### Test Infrastructure:

- Proper TypeScript support for tests
- Integration with React Testing Library and user-event

All tests are comprehensive and ensure the authentication system works correctly in all scenarios.

## Next Steps

The authentication system is ready for use. Future enhancements could include:

1. **Enhanced Authentication**: Add password-based authentication
2. **User Profiles**: Expand user profile management
3. **Session Permissions**: Add role-based access control
4. **Multi-user Sessions**: Support multiple users per session
5. **User Preferences**: Add user-specific settings and preferences
6. **Session Management**: Add more session features like session history, user roles, etc.

## Architecture Benefits
